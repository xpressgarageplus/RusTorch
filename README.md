> **PyTorch's API. Rust's Safety. The Next-Gen AI Infrastructure.**

**RusTorch** is a production-grade deep learning framework re-imagined in Rust. It combines the **usability** you love from PyTorch with the **performance, safety, and concurrency** guarantees of Rust. Say goodbye to GIL locks, GC pauses, and runtime errors. Say hello to **RusTorch**.

## 🚀 Why RusTorch?

*   **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Powered by `Rayon` for parallel CPU execution and optimized CUDA kernels (coming soon) for GPU. Zero-cost abstractions mean you pay for what you use.
*   **🛡️ Memory Safe**: Leveraging Rust's ownership model, RusTorch ensures memory safety without the overhead of a Garbage Collector. No more segfaults in production.
*   **🧠 PyTorch-like API**: If you know PyTorch, you already know RusTorch. We've meticulously mirrored the API design so you can switch instantly.
*   **🔮 JIT Graph Optimization**: Built-in XLA-style compiler that traces your code, fuses operators (e.g., Conv2d + ReLU), and eliminates dead code for maximum efficiency.
*   **🌐 Distributed Ready**: Native `DistributedDataParallel` support designed for modern multi-gpu, multi-node training clusters.

---

## 📦 Ecosystem

RusTorch is a modular workspace designed for scalability:

*   **`rustorch-core`**: The heart. N-dimensional Tensors, Autograd engine, and JIT compiler.
*   **`rustorch-nn`**: Neural network building blocks (Conv2d, LSTM, Transformer), Loss functions, and Optimizers.
*   **`rustorch-vision`**: Computer vision datasets (MNIST, CIFAR) and transforms.
*   **`rustorch-text`**: NLP primitives, Tokenizers, and Vocab.
*   **`rustorch-cuda`**: High-performance CUDA kernels.
*   **`rustorch-wasm`**: Run your models directly in the browser.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Add RusTorch to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rus-torch = "0.1.0"
```

### 🔥 Train a Model in 30 Seconds

```rust
use rus_torch::core::Tensor;
use rus_torch::nn::{Linear, Module, CrossEntropyLoss, SGD};

fn main() {
    // 1. Define a simple model
    let fc = Linear::new(10, 2); // Input: 10, Output: 2 classes
    
    // 2. Setup Loss & Optimizer
    let criterion = CrossEntropyLoss::new();
    let mut optimizer = SGD::new(fc.parameters(), 0.01);

    // 3. Dummy Data (Batch Size: 1, Features: 10)
    let input = Tensor::new(&[0.5; 10], &[1, 10]).set_requires_grad(true);
    let target = Tensor::new(&[1.0], &[1]); // Target Class 1

    // 4. Training Step
    optimizer.zero_grad();
    let output = fc.forward(&input);
    let loss = criterion.forward(&output, &target);
    loss.backward();
    optimizer.step();

    println!("🎉 Training step complete! Loss: {:?}", loss);
}
```
